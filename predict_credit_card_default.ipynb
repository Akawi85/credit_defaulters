The project uses data from the UCI Malchine Learning Repository [found here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients). The ultimate goal is to develop a model that predicts which clients will default on their credit card payment and those who wouldn't.\n","\n","The project is executed in the following outlines:\n","\n","- Exploratory data analysis\n","- preprocessing\n","- Application of neural network algorithm\n","- Application of different classification algorithms for model generation\n","- Selection of best prediction model\n","- Training on entire dataset\n","- Final notes\n","\n","The goal of this project is to create a reliable service for banks and other credit card issuance companies that will be able to detect clients who will default on the card repayments given some highlighted features of the client. This service will help these credit card issuance companies detect defaulters beforehand, thereby averting loss of credit, mitigate the cost of legal actions accrued as a result of default repayments, increase productivity of staff who will now spend less time verifying clients credibility, ensure smoother credit card issuance process for credible clients amongst others.\n","\n","The features of the dataset are as follows:\n","```\n","ID: ID of each client\n","\n","LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit\n","\n","SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)\n","\n","EDUCATION: (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 0, 4, 5, 6 = others).\n","\n","MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=divorced, 0=others)\n","\n","AGE: Age in years\n","\n","PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-2: No consumption; -1: Paid in full; 0: The use of revolving\n","credit, 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . ., 8 = payment delay for eight months,\n","9 = payment delay for nine months and above.)\n","\n","PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)\n","\n","PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)\n","\n","PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)\n","\n","PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)\n","\n","PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)\n","\n","BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)\n","\n","default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)\n","```\n","\n","More explicitly, the non self-explanatory columns are illustrated as:  \n","* PAY_0 and PAY_2–PAY_6: These columns show the status of repayments made by each credit-card customer whose details are listed in the dataset. The six columns cover repayments made from April 2005 through September 2005, in reverse order. For example, PAY_0 indicates a customer's repayment status in September 2005 and PAY_6 indicates the customer's repayment status in April 2005.  \n","In each of the six PAY_X columns, the status code -2 = Balance paid in full and no transactions this period (we may refer to this credit card account as having been 'inactive' this period), -1 means that payment was made on time and the\n","code 1 means that payment was delayed by one month. 0 = Customer paid the minimum due amount, but not the entire balance. I.e., the customer paid enough for their account to remain in good standing, but did revolve a balance. The codes 2 through 8 represent delays in payment by two through eight months, respectively. And 9 means that payment was delayed by nine\n","or more months.  \n","PAY_0 should ideally be renamed to PAY_1. This will ensure that the PAY_X names conform to the naming convention used for the BILL_AMTX and PAY_AMTX columns. It will also preclude any questions about why PAY_0 is followed immediately by PAY_2.\n","\n","* BILL_AMT1–BILL_AMT6: These columns list the amount billed to each customer from April 2005 through September 2005, in reverse order. The amounts are in New Taiwan (NT) dollars.\n","\n","\n","* PAY_AMT1–PAY_AMT6: These columns list, in reverse order, the amount that each customer paid back to the credit-card company from April 2005 through September 2005. Each of these amounts was paid to settle the preceding month's bill, either in full or partially. For example, each September 2005 amount was paid to settle the corresponding customer's August 2005 bill. The amounts are in NT dollars\n","\n","### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n","\n","For ease of analysis, the EDA will be performed using `Pandas-profiling` package.  \n","The `Pandas-Profiling` package generates profile reports (.html or other extensions) from a pandas DataFrame. As we know, the `pandas df.describe()` function is great but a little basic for serious exploratory data analysis. `pandas_profiling` extends the pandas DataFrame with `df.profile_report()` for quick data analysis.We get a great visual handy report to see the dossier about our data set.
